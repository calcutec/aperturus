                <p>Spreading rapidly through social media and often accompanied by heated debate, feminism appears to be gaining more popularity in the twenty first century. Although perceived differently today than it may have been in the 1960s, when the word was originally coined, feminism continues to advocate the same essential message: that everyone, regardless of gender, deserves to be equal. Such beliefs, however, have been circulating around for far longer than the past few decades. Throughout history, there have been individuals who have sought to reveal the damages caused by sexism, and, ultimately, pave the way toward gender equality. Although usually thought of as a period that predates feminism, the works of Victorian era British writer Christina Rossetti denounced detrimental societal ideologies pertaining to gender at that time. Her powerful and often controversial poems challenged traditional roles mandated for women and critiqued the position of females in Victorian England.</p>
                <p>Pre-Raphaelite poet Christina Georgina Rossetti is best recognized for her children’s verse Goblin Market and other Poems, as well as for her various essays, stories, and religious poetry. Born December 5, 1830 in London, England, Rossetti’s future, like all women’s futures during that time, was restricted to the stifling formalities of the Victorian lifestyle (Gale). Females were expected to desire marriage and motherhood, and to work in “separate spheres” than those of the other sex: A married couple, for instance, might meet only for breakfast and for supper (Hughes). Although much of her work was regarded as purely fantastical by readers in Victorian Britain, scholars today observe recurring connotations relating to the woman’s place in historic England and the dynamics between opposite genders (Casey).</p>
                <p>Possibly due to its blatantly controversial subject matter, the four-stanza poem “From the Antique” was never actually published during Rossetti’s lifetime. Unlike many other of her poems, Rossetti does little to disguise her beliefs, using unambiguous language to strengthen the voice of the poem. From the very beginning of the piece, an unmistakable sense of hopelessness and misery overwhelms the reader:</p>
            </div>

            <blockquote>
                <p>It's a weary life, it is, she said:</p>
                <p>Doubly blank in a woman's lot:</p>
                <p>I wish and I wish I were a man:</p>
                <p>Or, better than any being, were not [1-4]</p>
            </blockquote>

            <div class="columns">
                <p>In only four lines, the oppression of females in Victorian England is captured, as well as their “exclusion from key systems of power” (Avery). Women were unable to express their intellectuality for fear of being referred to as a “blue-stocking,” the name branded to those who were too passionately involved in educational pursuits. In order to find suitable husbands, knowledgeable young girls were encouraged to “soften [their] erudition” (Hughes). The poem suggests that to be a woman in Victorian Britain is so intolerable that even non existence would be superior to having to undergo a “blank” and “weary” life. At least in death, one would not be subject to the incessant and unrealistic expectations set for one’s gender.</p>
                <p>Written in 1856, “In an Artist’s Studio” explores a theme similar to that of “From the Antique.” Rossetti’s poem takes the form of the sonnet, a style traditionally used for romantic works. Rather than composing a tender and sentimental tone, however, she instead relays incisive criticism on the male's perception of women in Victorian England. </p>
                <p>The poem reflects on the way in which the male artist captures and controls the female model, and according to William Michael Rossetti (Christina Rossetti’s brother), is based off of the Pre-Raphaelite muse Elizabeth Siddal (Avery). It opens by describing the myriad of characters the male artist creates from one sole model:</p>
            </div>

            <blockquote>
                <p>One face looks out from all his canvasses,</p>
                <p>One selfsame figure sits or walks or leans;</p>
                <p>We found her hidden just behind those screens,</p>
                <p>That mirror gave back all her loveliness.</p>
                <p>A queen in opal or in ruby dress,</p>
                <p>A nameless girl in freshest summer greens,</p>
                <p>A saint, an angel;–every canvass means</p>
                <p>The same one meaning, neither more nor less… [1-8]</p>
            </blockquote>

            <div class="columns">
                <p>A few lines later,  this poem finishes with a concise and unflinching critique: “Not as she is, but as she fills his dream” [14].</p>
                <p>The poem begins by observing the similarities of the paintings, and how numerous figures can be attained with the assistance of a single model. It is almost as though the original woman the artist had been painting was taken apart and reconstructed as individuals with separate identities. No longer is she a person; she is subject to the artist’s desires of what he wants her to be, or “as she fills his dream.” Similar to “From the Antique,” the woman in this poem is confined and unable to reveal her true character. The theme that women were controlled by Victorian society’s perceptions of them rings clear yet again.</p>
                <p>Published in 1862, the comical poem “No, Thank You, John” describes a woman’s rejection of a pleading suitor (Avery). With no doubt or hesitancy in her mind, the narrator firmly explains her reasoning for why she will not accept his proposal.</p>
            </div>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I never said I loved you, John:</p>
                <p>Why will you tease me day by day,</p>
                <p>And wax a weariness to think upon</p>
                <p>With always ‘do’ and ‘pray’? [1-4]</p>
                <p>[….]</p>
                <p>I have no heart?–Perhaps I have not;</p>
                <p>But then you’re mad to take offence</p>
                <p>That I don’t give you what I have not got:</p>
                <p>Use your own common sense [13-16].</p>
           </blockquote>

            <div class="columns">
                <p>Through the character’s refusal of the admiror, Rossetti portrays the woman’s right to decline romantic offers. Women in Victorian Britain were expected to have husbands, yet “No, Thank You, John” suggests that women should be able to live independently or choose her romantic partners, free from the demands of a man or even society as a whole. Especially since it was written during a time when young men asked the fathers of their romantic interests for permission to marry as opposed to the girl herself, “No, Thank You, John” expresses a rather radical idea by describing a woman’s dismissal of a man’s proposal.</p>
                <p>Rossetti’s most renowned work, "Goblin Market," was originally published as a children’s narrative poem in 1862 (Gale). Although Rossetti claimed it was intended for a younger audience, its heavy and complicated themes have been scrutinized by many scholars over the years. While all sorts of observations and interpretations have been established, it seems as though certain themes remain in the forefront of their analyses: the poem’s emphasis on the concept of a “sisterhood,” the sexuality of females in the Victorian era, and the objectification of women.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="columns"
                <p>It is possible that Rossetti’s close relationship with her sister, Maria Francesca Rossetti, may have inspired her to write “Goblin Market.” The poem tells the story of two sisters, Laura and Lizzie, who are drawn to the goblin fruit market near their home. Despite Lizzie’s warnings, Laura is enticed by the calls of the goblins and offers a lock of her hair in return for fruit. Soon after eating the fruits, Laura grows ill and weak. Lizzie visits the goblins to see if they may have had something to do with her sister’s sickness, and they attempt to lure her as they had done with Laura. After no such luck, the goblins grow violent and try to fill her mouth with fruit, the juices staining her skin and clothes. She runs home to her sister, who kisses the juice off of Lizzie’s cheeks and is healed. The poem ends years after the incident with the two sisters explaining the importance of love between sisters.
                In one prominent line nearing the very end of the piece, Lizzie tells her children: “For there is no friend like a sister.” The concept of a sisterhood expands far past the relationship of the two sisters in the poem, however; many critics believe that the exclusion of male characters in the piece emphasizes the woman’s ability to be independent of men and instead rely on female companions. Other scholars disagree, believing that such a train of thought is too overt to capture Rossetti’s true intentions. For analysts in this category, the sisterhood depicted by the two main female characters reflects that females can be both “nurtured” as well as the “nurturer,” and that ultimately, all individuals can be both “redeemer” and “redeemed.” Laura and Lizzie’s relationship depicts a “kinship which is purged of its sexual bias in that it allows each sex to openly embrace both the ‘stronger’ and the ‘weaker’ sides of life.” (Casey). In “Goblin Market,” the traditional Victorian expectations set for each gender no longer matter, for everyone must share roles in order to be complete.
                Critics also find many references to the sexuality of the Victorian woman hidden throughout the lines of “Goblin Market.” Modern society perceives the Victorian woman as a “domestic angel,” completely subordinate to the power of her male counterpart. Directly in contrast to this “ideal” is the promiscuous “fallen woman.” “Goblin Market,” along with many other women’s works from the Victorian era, reveal how simplistic such views really are. Their works “consistently question the traditional sexual dichotomy by revealing a belief in the power—specially the moral power—of women” (Casey). Even when the goblin men begin to violently attack her, Lizzie restrains herself from accepting their temptations which suggests her moral strength. However, when Laura submits herself to the goblins and their fruit, she becomes desperately ill which indicates that her sexual desires caused her downfall, a prominent concept in Victorian Britain.
                One theme from “Goblin Market” in which all critics can agree on is the objectification of women. When Laura pleads for fruit, the goblin men demand she give them a strand of her hair. By treating her hair as a monetary item, she transforms her body into a simple commodity. Since the goblins arrange the terms in which Laura will pay them, Laura becomes a part of their patriarchal economic process, thus removing herself from the matriarchy that she shared with her sister (Welter).<p>
                <p>Although the term “feminism” may not have been invented until decades after the Victorian era, the works of Christina Rossetti challenged prejudiced beliefs relating to gender and critiqued Britain’s often sexist ideologies. In her poems, “From the Antique,” “In an Artist’s Studio,” “No, Thank You, John,” and “Goblin Market,” she condemns the archaic and unjust ways in which the Victorian belief system entrapped and suppressed women. Literature allows for silenced voices to be heard, and through the works of Christina Rossetti and countless other female writers, more realistic accounts on the lives of women during historic times can be acquired. </p>
