            <p>Spreading rapidly through social media and often accompanied by heated debate, feminism appears to be gaining more popularity in the twenty first century. Although perceived differently today than it may have been in the 1960s, when the word was originally coined, feminism continues to advocate the same essential message: that everyone, regardless of gender, deserves to be equal. Such beliefs, however, have been circulating around for far longer than the past few decades. Throughout history, there have been individuals who have sought to reveal the damages caused by sexism, and, ultimately, pave the way toward gender equality. Although usually thought of as a period that predates feminism, the works of Victorian era British writer Christina Rossetti denounced detrimental societal ideologies pertaining to gender at that time. Her powerful and often controversial poems challenged traditional roles mandated for women and critiqued the position of females in Victorian England.</p>
            <p>Pre-Raphaelite poet Christina Georgina Rossetti is best recognized for her children’s verse Goblin Market and other Poems, as well as for her various essays, stories, and religious poetry. Born December 5, 1830 in London, England, Rossetti’s future, like all women’s futures during that time, was restricted to the stifling formalities of the Victorian lifestyle (Gale). Females were expected to desire marriage and motherhood, and to work in “separate spheres” than those of the other sex: A married couple, for instance, might meet only for breakfast and for supper (Hughes). Although much of her work was regarded as purely fantastical by readers in Victorian Britain, scholars today observe recurring connotations relating to the woman’s place in historic England and the dynamics between opposite genders (Casey).</p>
            <p>Possibly due to its blatantly controversial subject matter, the four-stanza poem “From the Antique” was never actually published during Rossetti’s lifetime. Unlike many other of her poems, Rossetti does little to disguise her beliefs, using unambiguous language to strengthen the voice of the poem. From the very beginning of the piece, an unmistakable sense of hopelessness and misery overwhelms the reader:</p>
        </div>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>It's a weary life, it is, she said:</p>
                    <p>Doubly blank in a woman's lot:</p>
                    <p>I wish and I wish I were a man:</p>
                    <p>Or, better than any being, were not [1-4]</p>
                </blockquote>
        <div class="columns">
            <p>In only four lines, the oppression of females in Victorian England is captured, as well as their “exclusion from key systems of power” (Avery). Women were unable to express their intellectuality for fear of being referred to as a “blue-stocking,” the name branded to those who were too passionately involved in educational pursuits. In order to find suitable husbands, knowledgeable young girls were encouraged to “soften [their] erudition” (Hughes). The poem suggests that to be a woman in Victorian Britain is so intolerable that even non existence would be superior to having to undergo a “blank” and “weary” life. At least in death, one would not be subject to the incessant and unrealistic expectations set for one’s gender.</p>
            <p>Written in 1856, “In an Artist’s Studio” explores a theme similar to that of “From the Antique.” Rossetti’s poem takes the form of the sonnet, a style traditionally used for romantic works. Rather than composing a tender and sentimental tone, however, she instead relays incisive criticism on the male's perception of women in Victorian England. </p>
            <p>The poem reflects on the way in which the male artist captures and controls the female model, and according to William Michael Rossetti (Christina Rossetti’s brother), is based off of the Pre-Raphaelite muse Elizabeth Siddal (Avery). It opens by describing the myriad of characters the male artist creates from one sole model:</p>
        </div>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>One face looks out from all his canvasses,</p>
                    <p>One selfsame figure sits or walks or leans;</p>
                    <p>We found her hidden just behind those screens,</p>
                    <p>That mirror gave back all her loveliness.</p>
                    <p>A queen in opal or in ruby dress,</p>
                    <p>A nameless girl in freshest summer greens,</p>
                    <p>A saint, an angel;–every canvass means</p>
                    <p>The same one meaning, neither more nor less… [1-8]</p>
                </blockquote>
        <div class="columns">
            <p>A few lines later,  this poem finishes with a concise and unflinching critique: “Not as she is, but as she fills his dream” [14].</p>
            <p>The poem begins by observing the similarities of the paintings, and how numerous figures can be attained with the assistance of a single model. It is almost as though the original woman the artist had been painting was taken apart and reconstructed as individuals with separate identities. No longer is she a person; she is subject to the artist’s desires of what he wants her to be, or “as she fills his dream.” Similar to “From the Antique,” the woman in this poem is confined and unable to reveal her true character. The theme that women were controlled by Victorian society’s perceptions of them rings clear yet again.</p>
            <p>Published in 1862, the comical poem “No, Thank You, John” describes a woman’s rejection of a pleading suitor (Avery). With no doubt or hesitancy in her mind, the narrator firmly explains her reasoning for why she will not accept his proposal.</p>
        </div>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I never said I loved you, John:</p>
                    <p>Why will you tease me day by day,</p>
                    <p>And wax a weariness to think upon</p>
                    <p>With always ‘do’ and ‘pray’? [1-4]</p>
                    <p>[….]</p>
                    <p>I have no heart?–Perhaps I have not;</p>
                    <p>But then you’re mad to take offence</p>
                    <p>That I don’t give you what I have not got:</p>
                    <p>Use your own common sense [13-16].</p>
               </blockquote>
        <div class="columns">
            <p>Through the character’s refusal of the admiror, Rossetti portrays the woman’s right to decline romantic offers. Women in Victorian Britain were expected to have husbands, yet “No, Thank You, John” suggests that women should be able to live independently or choose her romantic partners, free from the demands of a man or even society as a whole. Especially since it was written during a time when young men asked the fathers of their romantic interests for permission to marry as opposed to the girl herself, “No, Thank You, John” expresses a rather radical idea by describing a woman’s dismissal of a man’s proposal.</p>
            Rossetti’s most renowned work, "Goblin Market," was originally published as a children’s narrative poem in 1862 (Gale). Although Rossetti claimed it was intended for a younger audience, its heavy and complicated themes have been scrutinized by many scholars over the years. While all sorts of observations and interpretations have been established, it seems as though certain themes remain in the forefront of their analyses: the poem’s emphasis on the concept of a “sisterhood,” the sexuality of females in the Victorian era, and the objectification of women.</p>
        </div>
               <p></p>
               <p><img src="{{url_for('.static', filename='img/goblin_market.png') }}" alt="" /></p>

        <div class="columns"
            <p>It is possible that Rossetti’s close relationship with her sister, Maria Francesca Rossetti, may have inspired her to write “Goblin Market.” The poem tells the story of two sisters, Laura and Lizzie, who are drawn to the goblin fruit market near their home. Despite Lizzie’s warnings, Laura is enticed by the calls of the goblins and offers a lock of her hair in return for fruit. Soon after eating the fruits, Laura grows ill and weak. Lizzie visits the goblins to see if they may have had something to do with her sister’s sickness, and they attempt to lure her as they had done with Laura. After no such luck, the goblins grow violent and try to fill her mouth with fruit, the juices staining her skin and clothes. She runs home to her sister, who kisses the juice off of Lizzie’s cheeks and is healed. The poem ends years after the incident with the two sisters explaining the importance of love between sisters.
            In one prominent line nearing the very end of the piece, Lizzie tells her children: “For there is no friend like a sister.” The concept of a sisterhood expands far past the relationship of the two sisters in the poem, however; many critics believe that the exclusion of male characters in the piece emphasizes the woman’s ability to be independent of men and instead rely on female companions. Other scholars disagree, believing that such a train of thought is too overt to capture Rossetti’s true intentions. For analysts in this category, the sisterhood depicted by the two main female characters reflects that females can be both “nurtured” as well as the “nurturer,” and that ultimately, all individuals can be both “redeemer” and “redeemed.” Laura and Lizzie’s relationship depicts a “kinship which is purged of its sexual bias in that it allows each sex to openly embrace both the ‘stronger’ and the ‘weaker’ sides of life.” (Casey). In “Goblin Market,” the traditional Victorian expectations set for each gender no longer matter, for everyone must share roles in order to be complete.
            Critics also find many references to the sexuality of the Victorian woman hidden throughout the lines of “Goblin Market.” Modern society perceives the Victorian woman as a “domestic angel,” completely subordinate to the power of her male counterpart. Directly in contrast to this “ideal” is the promiscuous “fallen woman.” “Goblin Market,” along with many other women’s works from the Victorian era, reveal how simplistic such views really are. Their works “consistently question the traditional sexual dichotomy by revealing a belief in the power—specially the moral power—of women” (Casey). Even when the goblin men begin to violently attack her, Lizzie restrains herself from accepting their temptations which suggests her moral strength. However, when Laura submits herself to the goblins and their fruit, she becomes desperately ill which indicates that her sexual desires caused her downfall, a prominent concept in Victorian Britain.
            One theme from “Goblin Market” in which all critics can agree on is the objectification of women. When Laura pleads for fruit, the goblin men demand she give them a strand of her hair. By treating her hair as a monetary item, she transforms her body into a simple commodity. Since the goblins arrange the terms in which Laura will pay them, Laura becomes a part of their patriarchal economic process, thus removing herself from the matriarchy that she shared with her sister (Welter).<p>
            <p>Although the term “feminism” may not have been invented until decades after the Victorian era, the works of Christina Rossetti challenged prejudiced beliefs relating to gender and critiqued Britain’s often sexist ideologies. In her poems, “From the Antique,” “In an Artist’s Studio,” “No, Thank You, John,” and “Goblin Market,” she condemns the archaic and unjust ways in which the Victorian belief system entrapped and suppressed women. Literature allows for silenced voices to be heard, and through the works of Christina Rossetti and countless other female writers, more realistic accounts on the lives of women during historic times can be acquired. </p>

{#            <p>I have a problem with bike saddles. I won’t show you a list of all the ones I’ve tried, as <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AAEbHDc5XUhHppXerIIF2i761NsCwNGNM4Y">that would just be embarrassing</a>. Most people seem to use whatever comes with their bike, and stick with that, but it’s taken me ages to find the ‘right one’ &#8211; comfortable, light (and,because I&#8217;m a Bike Tart) good looking. I also use my road bike to commute to the office, and finding something that is comfortable without padded tights is useful. (On that note, I’ve also found that white saddles and jeans don’t mix, unless you actually wanted an indigo saddle). </p>#}
{#            <p>Now to be clear, I&#8217;m talking road bike saddles here. My Pashley Guvnor has a lovely Brooks B17 in honey brown that is a fantastic saddle. Especially now that&#8217;s breaking in nicely (didn&#8217;t take long!). It just doesn&#8217;t look right on a carbon road bike though, and the weight makes it much less suitable. </p>#}
{#            <p><img src="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/else/images/brooks.jpg" alt="" /></p>#}
{#            <p>To try out so many saddles, I’ve been mostly picking them up secondhand on ebay. As well as others selling saddles that didn’t work out for them, you can often find cheaper versions with steel or manganese rails, rather than posher Titanium or Carbon. Its also likely that you can pick one up that has already been ‘broken in’, This is less of an issue than it is for <a href="http://brooksengland.com/">Brooks traditional leather saddles</a>, but I’ve found a used <a href="http://www.chargebikes.com/parts-collection/knife">Charge Knife</a> was more comfy and flexy than a brand new one.  This meant I could try one out, and if it didn&#8217;t suit, pop it back on ebay. There’s also a ‘Saddle Swap’ forum on Bikeradar&#8217;s Forums where you might find someone to exchange seats with.</p>#}
{#            <p>Here’s what I’ve learnt about saddles so far, but be warned, there is inevitable talk of my genitals…</p>#}
{##}
{#            <h3>Position</h3>#}
{#                <p>Even the smallest adjustment can turn a harsh saddle into a comfy one. There’s a lot to adjust too; height, position fore/aft, vertical angle (pointing the nose up/down very slightly, or keeping it dead level) and even horizontal angle. Unless you have an aero seatpost, it can also be tilted left/right very slightly. I’ve found some scooped saddles that need to be setup dead level, and some that need the back to rise slightly. The only way I’ve found to test a saddle properly is to ride it a bit, adjust it, ride for a bit again, rinse and repeat (A turbo trainer isn’t a great place to test saddles &#8211; they all feel harsh). After a while you can take note of how your sitting and adjust accordingly &#8211; e.g if I found myself pushing back on the saddle, it needed to be further forwards. </p>#}
{##}
{#            <h3>Shape</h3>#}
{#                <p>Saddles have different shapes &#8211; from flat ones (Fizik Arione, Selle Italia <span class="caps">SLR</span>) to rounded and scooped (Charge Spoon, Fizik Aliante, Prologo Scratch), as well as cutouts for dangling your delicate bits should you have them (Specialized Romin), or even with rails placed in the centre to allow the sides to flex while pedalling (Selle Italia Signo). The slightly rounded &amp; scooped shape seems to suit me best. Channels or cut outs don’t always work for me though, e.g the Romin cutout was OK but with the Fizik Aliante VS I could feel the edges of the channel digging in. </p>#}
{##}
{#            <h3>Padding</h3>#}
{#                <p>Padding is not necessarily a good thing &#8211; too much and it can cause chafing.  </p>#}
{##}
{#                <blockquote>#}
{#                    <p>If you think about it, a deck chair doesn&#8217;t have any padding and yet is still comfortable, so padding in itself is not the cure for an uncomfortable seat. A deck chair is comfortable because the fabric has tension in it and supports you with a low average pressure through-out the seat.</p>#}
{#                </blockquote>#}
{##}
{#                <p>I&#8217;ve tried saddle recently that pretty much just a carbon shell, with only a mm or two of padding, but it wasn&#8217;t as uncomfortable as it looked, due to the supportive shape. </p>#}
{##}
{#            <h3>Width</h3>#}
{##}
{#                <p><a href="http://www.specialized.com/gb/gb/hub/bodygeometryfit/">Specialized</a> focus on the width of your sit bones with their ‘Body Geometry’ saddles. The distance between the bones is measured, and then you choose a saddle with just enough width to support these bones, but no more. They are one of the few manufacturers that offer 3 different widths for their range. To measure your sit bones you can sit on a special gel-pad widget at the bike shop, or try and recreate it a home. Its quite a sight though, it involves sitting half-naked on carpeted stairs with tin foil under your cheeks and leaning forwards &#8211;  hoping to get two clear sit bones bumps in the foil.</p>#}
{##}
{#            <h3>Flex</h3>#}
{##}
{#                <p>The more expensive Carbon, and particularly Titanium, rails are meant to help filter out road buzz, but I can’t say I’ve felt any big difference. It feels like more of a slight weight advantage. I <em>have</em> found that Nylon bases are more flexible than Carbon ones though. </p>#}
{##}
{#            <h3>Spine</h3>#}
{##}
{#                <p><a href="http://www.fizik.it/">Fizik</a> have a system called ‘spine concept’ which looks at the riders flexibility rather than sit bones. From rigid ‘Bulls’ (unable to touch toes, which is me) to flexible ‘Snakes’ that can easily touch their toes easily. It may sound like marketing guff, but actually is quite common sense: I have low flexibility, so need to rotate my pelvis a lot of achieve a road riding position. I sit on the saddle with different parts of my undercarriage than someone with high flexibility. </p>#}
{##}
{#                <p>Fizik saddles are lovely, the quality is superb, and I love how they have a built in clip system, which makes it quick and easy to switch a saddlebag between bikes. Its the best system I&#8217;ve ever used.</p>#}
{##}
{#                <p><img src="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/else/images/arione.jpg" alt="" /></p>#}
{##}
{#                <p>The Arione (above) in particular has a stylish racy look that makes it &#8216;the saddle I wish I could fit&#8217;. Sadly it felt like sitting on a rail &#8211; too narrow to support my sit bones. The Antares was wide enough, but hard on the sit bones, while the Aliante (which has been my saddle choice so far) has been comfy on the sit bones but pushed up into my squashy bits a little too much on long rides. I’ve always felt that I needed a saddle shape inbetween the Aliante and Antares. </p>#}
{##}
{#            <h3>The one?</h3>#}
{##}
{#                <p><img src="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/else/images/fabric-logo.jpg" class="fr" />Two years ago, Charge Bikes (who make the Knife Saddle, and the very popular spoon) came out with a new product &#8211; the Charge Scoop. A simplified three-part construction: a foam top, vacuum bonded to a nylon base and rails, with no staples or glue. </p>#}
{##}
{#                <p><img src="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/else/images/scoop-header.jpg" alt="" /></p>#}
{##}
{#                <p>It was such a hit that other bike manufacturers wanted to spec the saddle, so it made sense to split off Scoop production into a separate company, and so the company <a href="http://fabric.cc/">Fabric</a> was born. Now these are being specced on Cannondales and the gorgeous new <a href="http://road.cc/content/news/143362-first-look-mason-progressive-cycles">Mason</a> range.</p>#}
{##}
{#                <p><img src="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/else/images/fabric.jpg" alt="" /></p>#}
{##}
{#                <p>This is the Fabric Scoop Shallow, and its now my favourite saddle. The level of fit and comfort is amazing, a revelation even, and it looks lovely! The shape is spot-on, the padding is comfortable without being too squishy, but I think the most important aspect is that the base is flexible. For the first time, I can sit on something, and really forget about. All my bikes now have a Scoop (with the exception of the Guvnor of course).</p>#}
{##}
{#                <p>I&#8217;ve also been trying out their rubbery knurled bar tape, and that&#8217;s great too. It&#8217;s very easy to wrap, cushioned with a gel backing (without adding too much bulk) and feels nice and grippy. Although similar, Lizard Skins tape was harder to wrap, and the tape moved about after a few weeks, leaving gaps. Fabric&#8217;s still looks as good months later. </p>#}
{##}
{#                <p>So fabric have won for me!</p>#}
